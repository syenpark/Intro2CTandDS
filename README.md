### __UNIT 1:__
#### Lecture 1
- Optimization models
  
  An objective function that is to be maximized or minimized
  
  A set of constraints (possibly empty)
  
- Greedy Algorithms
  Choose the best one in each step (locally), but this does not gurantee the final result  will be optimal. In spite of the drawback, this approach is still helpful to handle new and unsolved problems.

#### Lecture 2
- Brute Force Algorithms
- Recursive Fibonacci
- Dynamic Programming

#### Lecture 3
- Graphs
  Unlike tree, cycle can be included in graph.

- Finding the Shortest Path
  [Depth first search (DFS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlPuVe5Otio) VS. [Breadth first search (BFS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_V71Ejz3f4)

  For a weighted shortest path, use DFS.
